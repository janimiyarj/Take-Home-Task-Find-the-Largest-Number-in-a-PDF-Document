# Take-Home-Task-Find-the-Largest-Number-in-a-PDF-Document

This project intelligently extracts the **largest scaled numeric value** from a PDF using OpenAI's GPT model (e.g., millions, billions).

---

## Features

* Intelligent chunking of PDF text (number-rich content only)
* Understands scaling terms like "in millions" or "billion"
* Uses OpenAI to extract the largest numeric value per chunk
* Cleans hallucinated or invalid outputs
* Clean, production-friendly project structure with `.env` support

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pdf_number_extractor.git
cd pdf_number_extractor
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate         # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Add your OpenAI API key

Create a `.env` file in the root folder:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

>  **Important:** Keep your `.env` file private and add it to `.gitignore`.

---

## Running the Script

1. Place your target PDF file in the root folder.
2. Open `main.py` and make sure the correct filename is provided.
3. Run the script:

```bash
python main.py
```

Example output:

```
Chunk 1: 7,200,000
Chunk 2: 12,000,000
Chunk 3: 3,500,000

Largest Number Detected:
12,000,000
```

---

## .gitignore

Create a `.gitignore` file in the root with the following content:

```
.env
__pycache__/
*.pyc
*.pyo
*.DS_Store
venv/
```

---

## Requirements

Install all dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Dependencies:

```
openai>=1.0.0
PyMuPDF>=1.23.7
python-dotenv
```

---

## Source Files Overview

### `main.py`

Runs the end-to-end pipeline: extracts chunks, sends them to OpenAI, and prints the largest number.

### `extractor.py`

Extracts context-rich chunks from PDF using PyMuPDF. Skips irrelevant text and captures digit-heavy content.

### `openai_agent.py`

Contains the prompt template and logic to send each chunk to OpenAI and validate the numeric response.

### `utils.py`

Parses and scales numbers like "23 million" into `23000000`. Supports thousands, millions, billions, trillions.

### `config.py`

Loads OpenAI API key securely from the `.env` file using `python-dotenv`.

## Test Cases Handled by the Script

1. Skips Irrelevant Pages

Ignores pages with "This page intentionally left blank" or "Table of contents"

2. Ignores Non-Numeric Blocks

Only processes blocks that contain at least one digit

3. Handles Natural Language Context

Recognizes and scales terms like "in millions", "billions", "thousands", etc.

4. Chunk-Wise Context Management

Extracts 5 lines before and after the first numeric line for better understanding

5. Rejects Hallucinations

Validates and filters out responses like "12 trillion billion"

Ignores unexpected symbols or units returned by the model

6. Parallel Execution

Speeds up execution using ThreadPoolExecutor to call OpenAI in parallel

7. Returns Only Digits

Final output is purely numerical—no commas, units, or labels

8. Handles Edge Cases Gracefully

Returns 0 if no number is detected in a chunk

Returns the maximum among all scaled valid values

9. Tolerates Number Format Variations

Accepts numbers with commas (e.g., 1,000,000) and decimals (e.g., 3.2 million)

10. Maintains Deduplicated Context

Tracks seen lines across blocks to avoid duplicate content in overlapping chunks

11. Ignores Tables of Content and Headers

Filters out sections that don’t contribute numeric data, including cover blurbs

12. Scales Small Decimals Intelligently

Converts "2.45 million" to 2,450,000 using regex and postprocessing

13. Handles Mixed Content Blocks

If a block contains both narrative text and financial tables, it extracts only the informative parts

14. Avoids Over-Chunking

Respects a 250-word limit per chunk to optimize context window usage for OpenAI

15. Ignores Line Noise

Skips blocks made up of only symbols or repeated characters with no value

16. Avoids Duplicate Chunk Processing

Prevents lines from being reprocessed multiple times across blocks

17. Resilient to OCR Glitches

Ignores broken or malformed lines that are common in OCR-scanned PDFs

18. Handles Minimal-Text Pages

Skips pages that contain fewer than a threshold number of words

19. Validates Value Range

Rejects numbers that exceed realistic financial/scientific boundaries (>10^13)

20. Normalizes Decimal Separators

Accepts both commas and periods as decimal/group separators based on locale

21. Case-Insensitive Keyword Filtering

Recognizes headers like "MILLION" or "Billion" in any casing

22. Sanitizes Prompt Inputs

Removes extra whitespace or control characters from chunks before sending to OpenAI

23. Fail-Safe API Handling

Returns 0 for chunks if the OpenAI API times out or returns an error

24. Skips Redundant Descriptions

Avoids company descriptions or boilerplate text sections not containing numeric value

25. Prepares OpenAI-Friendly Prompts

Optimized prompt design ensures correct response from GPT with clear formatting instructions

## Model Comparison

| Model      | Speed       | Accuracy         | Notes                                   |
|------------|-------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **GPT (OpenAI)** | Moderate | High            | Most accurate for numeric parsing       |
| **Claude**       | Super fast | Hallucinates     | Fast but often generates wrong values   |
| **Gemini**       | Inconsistent | Low             | Often fails to identify relevant values |
